song written by chatgpt about love in stevenage

Verse 1:
In the town of Stevenage, I met you on a summer's day,
I was walking down the high street, and you caught my eye right away.
You were waiting at the bus stop, with a smile that lit up the sky,
And in that very moment, I knew I couldn't let you pass me by.

Chorus:
Oh Stevenage, my heart is yours,
You brought me love, that's for sure,
In your streets, we'll make sweet memories,
And forever we'll be, in love in Stevenage.

Verse 2:
We went to the park, and played on the swings,
Laughing and talking, enjoying the simple things.
We walked around Fairlands Lakes, hand in hand,
The sun was setting, and the sky was a beautiful blend.

Chorus:
Oh Stevenage, my heart is yours,
You brought me love, that's for sure,
In your streets, we'll make sweet memories,
And forever we'll be, in love in Stevenage.

Bridge:
I never thought I'd find love in this place,
But you came into my life, and put a smile on my face.
I thank my lucky stars, for bringing us together,
My love for you, will last forever.

Chorus:
Oh Stevenage, my heart is yours,
You brought me love, that's for sure,
In your streets, we'll make sweet memories,
And forever we'll be, in love in Stevenage.

Outro:
Oh Stevenage, my heart is yours,
You brought me love, that's for sure,
In your streets, we'll make sweet memories,
And forever we'll be, in love in Stevenage.
